## Bio


I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en" target="_blank"><b>École Polytechnique</b></a>. I work in parallel at <a href="https://globalmarkets.cib.bnpparibas" target="_blank"><b>BNP Paribas CIB</b></a>. Based in Paris, I am part of the Data & AI Lab within the quantitative resarch team of global markets, where I conduct fundamental and applied research on graph machine learning for financial markets.<br><br>

I am mainly interested in graph representation learning and graph signal processing. Curently, my work invovles modelling the dynamic network of user-item interactions for various downstream tasks, such as market prediction and product recommendations. <br><br>

In April 2021, after 6 years of higher eduction, I have graduated with a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en" target="_blank"><b>École Polytechnique</b></a>, a Master of Engineering in Image Processing and Data Science from <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr" target="_blank"><b>Télécom Paris</b></a>, and a Master of Engineering in Telecommunication and Computer Science from <a href="http://www.ulfg.ul.edu.lb" target="_blank"><b>Lebanese University</b></a>.
